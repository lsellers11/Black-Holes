Numerical Simulations of Black Holes and particle physics.

Project Descriptions:

1. Higgs_Kerr2D_Tortoise_no_omega.ipynb

  Non-linear time domain evolution of the abelian Higgs field on a kerr spacetime background in 2+1 polar coordinates. Superradiance is observed.
  
2. MassiveScalar_Kerr2D_Tortoise_no_omega.ipynb

  Same time domain evolution code as [1], but for a linear scalar field. Exponential growth for the massless case currently indicates   propagation of numerical instability. 
  
3. minkbtimestepRandI.ipynb

  Non-linear time domain evolution of the abelian Higgs field in 2+1 polar coordinates on flat spacetime with a coupling anti-friction term in the Lagrangian. Superradiance is observed.
  
4. higgsplotscipy.ipynb

  Non-linear time domain evolution of the abelian Higgs field in 2+1 cartesian coordinates on flat spacetime with a coupling anti-friction term in the Lagrangian. Superradiance is observed.
